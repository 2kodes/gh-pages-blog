gh-pages-blog was designed to be a simple and quick solution to creating a responsive blog and website using the GitHub Pages functionality available to all GitHub accounts and hosted projects.

Start with forking the [gh-pages-blog](http://www.github.com/thedereck/gh-pages-blog) project, then take a gander at the _config.yml file. The config file has lots of comments that make an effort at making the configuration easier. After making the changes you feel are appropriate for your site, upload it to your GitHub Page and see how it looks. Tweek from there.

If you want to change the Bootstrap theme, you can download some from the Bootswatch website. You may need to play around a bit with the gh-pages-blog.css file though to get things just right. But chances are it will work just fine, or well enough.

If you run into a bug, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/thedereck/gh-pages-blog/issues).

Enjoy your blogging experience.
